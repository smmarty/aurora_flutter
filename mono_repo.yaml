# Enabled GitHub actions - https://docs.github.com/actions
# If you have no configuration, you can set the value to `true` or just leave it
# empty.
github:
  # Specify the `on` key to configure triggering events.
  # See https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on
  # The default values is
  # on:
  #   push:
  #     branches:
  #       - main
  #       - master
  #   pull_request:

  # Setting just `cron` is a shortcut to keep the defaults for `push` and
  # `pull_request` while adding a single `schedule` entry.
  # `on` and `cron` cannot both be set.
  cron: '0 0 * * 0' # “At 00:00 (UTC) on Sunday.”

  # Specify additional environment variables accessible to all jobs

  # You can group stages into individual workflows
  #
  # Any stages that are omitted here are put in a default workflow
  # named `dart.yml`.
  workflows:

  # You can add custom github actions configurations to run after completion
  # of all other jobs here. This accepts normal github job config except that
  # the `needs` config is filled in for you, and you aren't allowed to pass it.

    # Example job that pings a web hook url stored in a github secret with a
    # json payload linking to the failed run.

      # By default this job will only run if all dependent jobs are successful,
      # but we want to run in the failure case for this purpose.

  # You can customize stage ordering as well as make certain stages be

# When using `test_with_coverage`, this setting configures the service that
